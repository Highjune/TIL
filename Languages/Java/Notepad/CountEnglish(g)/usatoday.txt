As the Senate moves toward pivotal votes on witnesses and the articles of impeachment, Republican senators who decide that Donald Trump's shakedown of Ukraine was sleazy, but not worth removing him from office, still have a problem. They risk angering a president who insists his actions were "perfect" and beyond reproach.

In the face of a such a dilemma, senators were offered an escape hatch this week by Trump lawyer Alan Dershowitz: Don't worry about what Trump did, Dershowitz assured the senators. You can tell your constituents that if the president didn't commit a crime, he can't be impeached and removed from office. 

In other words, it doesn't matter if the president withheld nearly $400 million in congressionally approved military aid from Ukraine for the selfish purpose of acquiring political dirt on former Vice President Joe Biden. Or that Trump stonewalled Congress' investigation.
